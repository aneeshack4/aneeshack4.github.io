    <h1> Aneesha Kommineni <h1>
    <h4> <p> Currently on vacation after graduating early from The University of Texas at Austin with my Bachelor's in Computer Science! 
             Returning to Microsoft in April 2017 as a Software Engineer after having an absolute blast interning there this past summer.</p> </h4>
    <h5> <p> Previously, I interned at Apple, Google (twice), and Bank of America. I also TA'd in my CS Department two semesters and held numerous leadership positions in the student organizations. <span style="background-color: #FF69B4"> I'm passionate about building products with inclusive user experiences and helping to make the tech industry more inclusive and diverse to reflect the user base (which is essentially the planet's population) of the products we create.</span> I've indulged this passion through many ways including the founding of a new organization and an annual diversity conference at UT. I will continue to go after these goals in this next chapter of my life - stay tuned to see how! </p>
